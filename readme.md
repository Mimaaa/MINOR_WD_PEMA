# Performance Matters

## Critical CSS

I thought implementing the critical css would be a huge hassle and really difficult to do, but it's actually a lot simpler that I thought. I can imagine automating this process through for example Gulp would be easier when managing a really big project.

I used the minified CSS bundle to generate the critical CSS and then minified the critical CSS as well.

Improvements by implementing the critical CSS:

- 12 points according to the Google Performance test
- 14."" seconds on DOM load and 10."" seconds on final load
