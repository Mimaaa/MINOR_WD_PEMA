# Performance Matters

## Developing branch

The purpopse of the developing branch is to eventually merge all feature branches in to this one so I can test all features in one place and see the end result.

I've alreadye enabled gZip compression on this branche and it already improved the performance of the website by a lot, as you can see below.

Improvements by enabling compression:

- 12 points according to the Google Performance test
- 12."" seconds on DOM load and 11."" seconds on final load
