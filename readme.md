# Performance Matters

## TO-DO

- optimizing font-load with FontFaceObserver
- load styles async (LOADCSS)
- optimize script loading (defer)
- merging feature branches

I have not merged the feature branches yet because I'm really scared of breaking everything, so I'll leave that on the to-do till Monday when I can get some help.

## Master branch (original files)

I started with the original files and did some tests to see how long it took to render usable data and I also ran a performance test on Google's website.

The following happened:

As you can see there is a lot of work to do on improving the performance of the Bootstrap website.
