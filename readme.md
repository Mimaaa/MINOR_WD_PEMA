# Performance Matters

## Minify branch

I started with miniyfing the CSS & JS: I bundled all the CSS and minified that, then I minified the JS as well.

The increase in performance was not incredibly significant, but all the little things help.

Improvements by minifying files:

- 7 points according to the Google Performance test
- 1."" seconds on DOM load and 2.4" seconds on final load
